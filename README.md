# Automation Project: Selenium + Jenkins + GitHub

## Overview
This project demonstrates a robust test automation framework using **Selenium WebDriver**, **TestNG**, **Maven**, and **Jenkins**. It is designed to automate end-to-end testing for [Automation Practice](http://automationpractice.com/), a sample e-commerce website.

## Key Features
- **Modular Design**:
  - Organized into `base`, `pages`, and `testcases` directories for better maintainability and scalability.
  - Implements **Page Object Model (POM)** for reusable and organized code.
- **Data-Driven Testing**:
  - Utilizes **Excel** files for dynamic test data input.
  - Ensures reusability and flexibility of test cases.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
  - Integrated with **Jenkins** for automated test execution upon code commits in **GitHub**.
  - Maven handles dependency management and build lifecycle.
- **Detailed Reporting and Logging**:
  - Generates comprehensive **HTML reports** using Extent Report.
  - Logs execution details with **Log4j**, enhancing debugging efficiency.

## CI/CD Pipeline
1. **GitHub**:
   - Stores the source code and tracks changes.
2. **Jenkins**:
   - Configured to detect GitHub commits and trigger automated tests.
3. **Maven**:
   - Handles dependency management and executes tests using `clean test`.
4. **Extent Report**:
   - Produces detailed HTML reports for test results.

## Key Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Java
- **Automation Frameworks**: Selenium WebDriver, TestNG
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub
- **Reporting**: Extent Report
- **Logging**: Log4j

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coolmich0904/automation-project.git
   ```
2. Configure the `config.properties` file:
   - Set the test site URL and browser settings.
3. Execute tests locally:
   ```bash
   mvn clean test
   ```
4. Set up Jenkins:
   - Create a new Jenkins job linked to the GitHub repository.
   - Configure Jenkins to trigger `mvn clean test` for builds.

## Notable Test Scenarios
- Automated functional and regression tests for critical user flows such as:
  - Login and authentication.
  - Adding products to the cart and verifying checkout.
  - Contact form submission and wishlist management.
- Used Excel for input data during testing to ensure flexibility in data handling.

## Screenshots
(Include screenshots here, such as folder structure, Jenkins jobs, or Extent Reports.)

## Additional Notes
- The project demonstrates integration of Selenium WebDriver with Jenkins and GitHub for seamless CI/CD workflows.
- Designed with maintainability in mind, following best practices for modular test automation.

## License
This project is for educational purposes and showcases automation testing best practices.

### **Changes Made to Add Clarity**
1. **All Korean descriptions translated into English**:
   - Added clear and concise details about how the project integrates Jenkins, GitHub, and Maven.
   - Focused on highlighting modular design and automation processes.

2. **Folder structure clarified**:
   - Explained the purpose of directories like `base`, `ddt`, and `resources`.

3. **Added sections on "Key Technologies Used" and "Notable Test Scenarios"**:
   - These sections help demonstrate the real-world applicability of the project.

4. **Screenshots Placeholder**:
   - A reminder to include screenshots for further credibility (e.g., folder structure, Jenkins setup, Extent Report outputs).

5. **Consistent Formatting**:
   - Used `bash` for code blocks and ensured headers are properly styled with `##` and `###`.
